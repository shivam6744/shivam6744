## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Shibu* and i'm trying to learn github to break into tech as a **Cloud Engineer**. 

Its hard to learn so many commands for **Python, Linux and Github** but looks like eventually we will get there.

> As of now, i'm in **Feature Branch**, and i dont know if its actually true but lets see

> Okee, so this one is in the **Test Branch** supposedly.

> So this one is the **Mayo Branch**

Until then, here's a picture of me /https://images.app.goo.gl/trKDkBy7f2mNDSm27

*I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord*

> Remember this while working with Vscode that if you get a error while committing or pushing a code and it says *Nothing to Commit, working tree clean

> Then what you need to do is, first click **ctrl+ s** so the changes are saved locally
> Then **Git add .** and then **git commit -m " My comment"** and then **git push origin main**

imma paste the link of the website here as well where i can get these commands and a couple more things:

[This is the freecodecamp website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-markdown-in-vscode/)
Also, im gonna add a random table here just so i can, so why not :)

First|second
-|-
1|2
3|4

> So what i can do is add one more tbale and try to sync it.

Learn|Git
-|-
Not|Easy
Not|Hard either

Also, this is a `code` or maybe `this one`

Looks like i can even add a **Link** and that too embedded in a text, like [WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)

Now *Supposedly* adding image link is similar to adding a regular link, different being the **!**

Im gonna leave this section for now.

So what i'm gonna do is *add one more table, just so i can, thats called **Use of Free Will***

New|Table
-|-
5|6
7|8

`Lemme try one last time to check what happens if i save it first by clicking Ctrl + s and then add, commit and push`

> Ain't gonna be easy but lets try

```Now the document says
if the code is more than
one line, you can put
Three of those symbols
```
```python
print ("hello")
```
