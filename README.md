## Hi there 👋

My name is *Shibu* and i'm trying to learn github to break into tech as a **Cloud Engineer**. 

Its hard to learn so many commands for **Python, Linux and Github** but looks like eventually we will get there.

Until then, here's a picture of me /https://images.app.goo.gl/trKDkBy7f2mNDSm27

Also, im gonna add a random table here just so i can, so why not :)
