## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Shibu* and i'm trying to learn github to break into tech as a **Cloud Engineer**. 

Its hard to learn so many commands for **Python, Linux and Github** but looks like eventually we will get there.

Until then, here's a picture of me /https://images.app.goo.gl/trKDkBy7f2mNDSm27

> Document said this is gonna be a quoted text if i put greater than sign in front of it, lets see

Also, im gonna add a random table here just so i can, so why not :)

First|second
-|-
1|2
3|4

Also, this is a `code` or maybe `this one`

Looks like i can even add a **Link** and that too embedded in a text, like [WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)

So what i'm gonna do is *add one more table, just so i can, thats called **Use of Free Will***

New|Table
-|-
5|6
7|8

```Now the document says
if the code is more than
one line, you can put
Three of those symbols
```
```python
print ("hello")
```
